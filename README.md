# Flutter Steps Tracker

It's an open source project for the steps tracking (Pedometer) built with Flutter and integrated with Firebase as the initial backend service.

Some of the features should have been in the server-side using cloud functions, but there were some problems with that and it will be available soon with some configuration instructions to work on one server.

So you may find some workarounds that will be more accurate and better after adding the server-side functions.
